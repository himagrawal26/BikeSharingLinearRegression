# BikeSharingLinearRegression

# Problem Statement: To make a Linear Regression model for predicting the demand of bikes to take on rent per day and get some valuable insights which factors are affecting the demand. As during COVID-19 situation, BoomBikes faced a huge decline in the demand for bike rentals and now they want to understand which parameters are affecting the demand and how to increase the demand.

# Data Understanding: Dataset has 2 years data - 2018 & 2019 in which weather situations, temp, season, holiday, workingday etc, fetures are given and output variable is 'cnt' which is demand of bike rentals per day.

# Steps followed:
- Data Understanding
- Data visualisation & EDA
- Linear model preparation (Train test split, Feature scaling, Prediction, R2, Adjusted R2, VIF, RMSE)
- Prediction and Checking Accuracy for train and test set
- Comparing models in order to find the best model
- Residual Analysis (Linear Regression Assumption)
- Making Linear Regression Equation
- Conclusion and Suggestions
